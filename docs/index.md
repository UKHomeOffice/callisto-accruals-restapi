# Accruals system

In Border Force many people are on what is known as an Annualised Hours Agreement (AHA). In short each person will have a set of target hours that they need to work in order to gain an uplift in their basic pay. 

The hours that they work fall into one or more different categories, which are sometimes called modules or often reffered to as accruals.

### User goals
Boiling it down, Accruals supports four key areas of functionality 

- Calculating accrual balances 
- Viewing balance(s)
- Tracking balances changes over time
- Viewing how balances have changed over time (statement)
